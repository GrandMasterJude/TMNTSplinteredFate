            <div id="tips">
                <ul class="tips-list">
                    <li>If you're just starting out make sure to get a second <a href="upgrades.html#upgrade-dash-charge" target="_blank">dash</a> and <a href="upgrades.html#upgrade-splinters-revive" target="_blank">Splinter's Revive.</a></li>
                    <li>After that all the upgrades are good but don't neglect the <a href="upgrades.html#upgrade-swiftness" target="_blank">Swiftness</a> upgrade. Being able to move out of the way helps you live a lot longer.</li>
                    <li>Upgrade your <a href="inspirations.html" target="_blank">Inspirations</a>.</li>
                    <li>Don't pollute your build too much. The game is weighted towards giving you the same type of <a href="powers.html" target="_blank">Powers</a> you already have. <a href="powers.html" target="_blank">Powers</a> are generally stronger the more you have of the same type, so don't be afraid to take another room reward if you aren't offered the flavor of <a href="powers.html" target="_blank">Power</a> you want. If you're going for a Flame and Water build, picking up an Utrom <a href="powers.html" target="_blank">Power</a> can't hurt you more than you think. You're better off taking the scrap so you can buy another Flame or Water <a href="powers.html" target="_blank">Power</a> at the next Shop instead.</li>
                    <li>Scrap is good. Being able to consistently get to the first Shop with 400 scrap to buy a <a href="powers.html" target="_blank">Power</a> is a big milestone.</li>
                    <li>Once you can get there with 800 or 1200 scrap save your dice to reroll the Shop to buy multiple <a href="powers.html" target="_blank">Powers</a>.</li>
                    <li><a href="upgrades.html#upgrade-do-over" target="_blank">Dice</a> are great. If you reroll the Shop all the options will be available to buy again.</li>
                    <li>Global damage boosts are great. If a <a href="powers.html" target="_blank">Power</a> doesn't specifically say Attack Damage or Special Damage it applies to <i>all</i> damage you do. Your attack, special, tools, shuriken, Master Strike, etc., and also damage over time. So if you have an Ooze build and pick up <a href="powers.html#power-ninja-first-strike" target="_blank">First Strike</a>, you'll notice that every time you dash your Ooze will deal more damage for a second. <a href="powers.html#power-water-still-waters" target="_blank">Still Waters</a> is great since it boosts everything until you do a regular attack. <a href="powers.html#power-astral-d-dark-star" target="_blank">Astral Dark</a> also has some big bonuses. Have fun experimenting and seeing what you can come up with.</li>
                    <li>None of these are hard and fast rules, the more you play the game the more you'll know when to break them.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Donatello's Math Nerd Section</h3>
                <p>Math in this game is additive not multiplicative.</p>
                <p>This means percent increases are additive and work off of your base damage. You don't multiply the result of your +% increase by your next +% increase.</p>

                <p class="margin-top">So for example, Raphael's basic attack deals 24 damage. Critical Hits do +100% damage, so when he does a crit it will do 49 damage.</p>
                <p>*Raph gets the extra 6% crit damage from his inspiration, so it's +25 instead of 24.</p>
                <p class="margin-top margin-left"><span class="mobile-yep keep-spaces">   </span>24 base damage <br class="mobile-yep">+ 25 crit damage <br class="mobile-yep">= 49</p>
                <p class="margin-top">After he buys some upgrades and has +50% attack, his first attack will do 36 damage but his crits will only do 61, not 74 like you might expect.</p>
                <p class="margin-top margin-left"><span class="mobile-yep keep-spaces">   </span>24 base damage <br class="mobile-yep">+ 12 upgrade damage <br class="mobile-yep">+ 25 crit damage <br class="mobile-yep">= 61</p>
                <p class="margin-top">Or another way of looking at that is</p>
                <p class="margin-top margin-left"><span class="mobile-yep keep-spaces">   </span>24 <br class="mobile-yep">x 256% <br class="mobile-yep">(100% + 50% + 106%) <br class="mobile-yep">= 61.44</p>
                <p class="margin-top"></p>
                <p class="margin-top">Let's look at another example with several bonuses.</p>
                <p>Leonardo has his attack damage upgraded to +60% and Dash Attack damage to +25%.</p>
                <p>On this run he picked up the <a href="mastery.html#mastery-l-4" target="_blank">+30% Dash Attack Damage Mastery</a> and just got the <a href="boosts.html#boost-attack-damage" target="_blank">+50% Attack Damage Boost</a>.</p>
                <p>His base Dash Attack damage is 25. So now when he hits an enemy he will deal 66.25 damage</p>
                <p class="margin-top margin-left"><span class="mobile-yep keep-spaces">   </span>25 Base <br class="mobile-yep">+ 15 Upgrade <br class="mobile-yep">+ 6.25 Dash Attack <br class="mobile-yep">+ 7.5 Mastery <br class="mobile-yep">+ 12.5 Boost <br class="mobile-yep">= 66.25</p>
                <p class="margin-top">Or another way of looking at that is</p>
                <p class="margin-top margin-left"><span class="mobile-yep keep-spaces">   </span>25 <br class="mobile-yep">x 265% <br class="mobile-yep">(100% + 60% + 25% <br class="mobile-yep">+ 30% + 50%) <br class="mobile-yep">= 66.25</p>
